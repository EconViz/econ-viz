"""Backend-neutral scene factories (mosaickit layers) for the economic components.

Each factory turns a solved/derived economic object into immutable mosaickit layers with
concept-local roles (``utility.budget``, ``utility.equilibrium``, ``utility.indifference``).
Nothing here imports Matplotlib or the legacy drawing modules; rendering is done by
mosaickit (``Canvas.save``) with :data:`UTILITY_THEME`, or export TikZ with
:func:`canvas_to_tikz` (curves are native Bezier paths from bezierkit).
